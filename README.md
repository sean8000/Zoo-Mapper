# Zoo Mapper

## About
This python program is a resource to go along with ZooMonitorÂ© and other animal data collection applications. ZooMapper creates plots for 2D and 3D datasets, allows for interactive viewing and filtering of data, and can perform calculations for distances between animals. 

### File Structure
- `/data`: folder to contain data files, either as .xlsx or .csv
- `/src/main/resources`: contains image assets
- `/src/main`: python files
  - `zoo.py`: Main program file. Contains methods for handling imports, exporting distance calculations, and the spreadsheet view
  - `heatmap.py`: Handles methods for creating import configuration, and saving an import
  - `heatmappage.py`: Plotting of graphs, highlighting points, and real time distance calculating on graph
  - `pages.py`: Frames for the different pages of the application
  - `error.py`: provides error messages for error handling
- `/src/main/saves`: contains save configurations of imports. Saves as `.json` files
